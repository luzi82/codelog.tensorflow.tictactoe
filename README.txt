Just some sample code to deep learning the tictactoe.
I just want to learn how to do deep learning in tensorflow, so it is not coded to be really strong.

The loss function:
loss = Q(s,a) - R(s,a) - max(Q(s',i)) + L2

It does not aware the min part of opponent, so it may have some problem.
However, I dont care...  I save some time for codelog.tensorflow.tetris .
